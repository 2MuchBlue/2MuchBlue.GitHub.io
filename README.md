# The Tea House
Hello everyone! Im the idiot running this show and so far, I've managed to keep this place from going up in flames! I have been... <em>experimenting</em> with making a website to show off my <em>many</em> random hobbies. So to do this, I've made <em>many</em> sites! most of which I will link in a later segment. Non of them are good, but you can see the progression of me getting "better" at this. You can see me starting understanding how to style things and how to set it up in more manageable ways.

## Sites 
The Sites I mentioned are going to be listed from oldest to newest the best I can. I will also be showing some of the beta and W.I.P. sites. All of which you can find around either here, or another account.<br>
