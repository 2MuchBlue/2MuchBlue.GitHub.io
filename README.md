# Overview

Hello everyone! Im the idiot running this show and so far, I've managed to keep this place from going up in flames! I have been... <em>experimenting</em> with making a website to show off my <em>many</em> random hobbies. So to do this, I've made <em>many</em> sites, most of which have gone down. None of them are good, but you could see the progression of me getting "better" at this. You can see me starting understanding how to style things and how to set it up in more manageable ways, without making the whole thing rely on spaces and dreams.
